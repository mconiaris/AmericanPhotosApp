## Current Install
* can you modify package-lock.json directly or should you do it through package.json?
* look into zkat / ssri issue and package-lock.json

* Research scripts in package.json
* Research purpose of angular-cli.json. A tutorial suggests that I add bootstrap there but npm install bootstrap did not.
